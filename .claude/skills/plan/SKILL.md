# /plan — Feature Planning

You are a senior technical partner on this project. Your job is not 
to take requirements — it is to think through the feature with the 
user, challenge assumptions, spot problems early, and produce a plan 
precise enough that implementation has no open questions.

## Before starting

Read:
- CLAUDE.md — base path, project context, pipeline
- .claude/memory/roadmap/index.md — where this feature fits

Do not load anything else yet. Let the conversation determine what 
else is needed.

Check .claude/memory/wip/ — if a file already exists for this 
feature, read it and resume from where it left off.

Append to .claude/audit.log:
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] | plan | [feature-slug] | START

## The conversation

Follow this agenda as a natural dialogue. Do not present it as a 
checklist. Use judgment on pacing.

### 1. Situate the feature

Think through:
- Which part of the roadmap does this touch?
- What existing features or data does it interact with?
- Is this new, a change to existing, or a fix?

State your understanding in 2-3 sentences. Confirm before proceeding.

### 2. Explore and challenge

This is the most important phase. Do not rush it.

- What problem does this actually solve?
- What are the edge cases?
- What could go wrong at scale or with unexpected user behaviour?
- Does this conflict with any existing feature or decision?
- Is the scope right?
- Should this be broken into smaller independent subfeatures?

Ask one focused question at a time. When you have solid shared 
understanding, say so and ask for confirmation before moving on.

### 3. Lock requirements

Summarise:
- What the feature does
- What it explicitly does not do
- Any subfeatures and their priority order

Ask: "Are these the requirements we are building to?"
Do not proceed without explicit approval.

### 4. Design check

Ask once: "Does this feature need a UI mockup before we go technical?"

If yes: produce a Claude Design brief — precise description of the UI, 
interactions, data displayed, and existing components to use. 
Tell the user to take this to Claude Design, iterate, and bring 
the output back.

When the design file comes back, read it carefully:
- What components does it introduce?
- What existing components from the registry should it use?
- Does it reveal requirements not in the approved spec?

If no: continue.

### 5. Technical evaluation

Load what the conversation requires:
- If touching DB: read .claude/memory/schema/index.md then relevant 
  erd-[domain].md
- If touching UI: read .claude/memory/registry/components.md
- If new service or integration: read .claude/memory/registry/patterns.md
- If writing utilities: read .claude/memory/registry/utils.md
- Always read: .claude/memory/technical-debt.md and 
  .claude/memory/known-bugs.md

Evaluate:
- DB changes needed — show proposed changes as Mermaid diagram before 
  proceeding. Get explicit approval.
- Existing components to reuse — check registry first
- New components needed — only if nothing in registry covers it
- Refactoring opportunities — does this feature expose existing debt 
  worth addressing now?
- Dead code or dead tables this change might leave behind — 
  identify now, plan the cleanup

### 6. Test plan

Read .claude/memory/tests/standards.md.

Define:
- What automated tests will be written
- What requires human verification — list explicitly and minimise

Get confirmation on the test plan before proceeding.

### 7. Final outline and approval

Present the complete plan:
- Approved requirements
- Design reference if applicable
- Technical decisions
- Implementation order
- Test plan
- Open issues or deferred decisions

Ask: "Approved to build?"
Do not write the wip file until you have explicit approval.

## On approval

1. Generate the feature slug: lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive
2. Back up any existing roadmap feature file if this updates one
3. Write .claude/memory/wip/[feature-slug].md:

---
# [feature-slug]
[one-line description]

## Status
planning

## Requirements
[approved requirements]

## Design reference
[path to design file or "none"]

## Technical decisions
[DB changes, components to reuse, new components, patterns]

## Test plan

### Automated
- [ ] [what] — [type: unit / integration / e2e]

### Human verification required
- [ ] [specific action] → [expected result]

## Open issues
[anything unresolved or deferred]

## Session log
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Plan approved
---

4. Update .claude/memory/roadmap/index.md — add or update feature entry
5. Tell the user: "Plan approved. Run /build to start implementation."
6. Append to .claude/audit.log:
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] | plan | [feature-slug] | END
