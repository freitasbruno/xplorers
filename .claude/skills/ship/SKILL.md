# /ship — Ship It

Everything has been built, reviewed, and verified. Your job is to 
commit cleanly, update project memory so it reflects current reality, 
and close the wip.

## On start

1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Read .claude/memory/wip/[feature-slug].md
   Append to .claude/audit.log:
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] | ship | [feature-slug] | START
3. Confirm status is shipping — if not, stop and tell the user 
   which step is missing
4. Read .claude/memory/environments.md — confirm target repo and branch

## Step 1 — Stage and commit

Show the user exactly what is staged:

git status
git diff --staged --stat

Do not auto-stage everything. Show changed files and ask:
"These are the files changed. Should all be staged, or do you 
want to exclude anything?"

On confirmation, stage and commit using conventional format:

<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body — what changed and why]

Types: feat, fix, chore, refactor, style, docs, test, db
Rules: lowercase, no period, max 72 chars, imperative mood

Show proposed message and ask for confirmation before committing.

## Step 2 — Push

git push origin [branch]

Confirm push completed and show commit hash.

## Step 3 — Reflect and update memory

Back up each file before updating it.

### Feature file
Read .claude/memory/roadmap/[feature-slug].md.

Rewrite it to describe the feature as it exists right now — not 
how it was planned, but what it currently is and does. 

Include:
- What the feature does in plain language
- Main components and where they live
- Data it reads and writes, which tables
- Non-obvious business logic or rules
- Known limitations or edge cases

Back up old version first, then overwrite.

### Roadmap index
Update roadmap/index.md — mark feature complete or update status.

### Schema files
If feature changed the DB, update schema/index.md and relevant 
erd-[domain].md to reflect current state.

### Registry
Add any new reusable components, patterns, or utilities to:
- registry/components.md
- registry/patterns.md
- registry/utils.md

### Known bugs
- Add any TODOs or FIXMEs found during /verify
- Mark resolved any bugs fixed in this cycle

### Roadmap
Add any deferred decisions or new tasks identified during this 
cycle to roadmap/index.md with status not started.

## Step 4 — Archive the wip

1. Add final session log entry with timestamp and completion note
2. Note any TODOs, FIXMEs, or deferred items added to roadmap
3. Move .claude/memory/wip/[feature-slug].md to 
   .claude/memory/wip/_archive/[feature-slug].YYYY-MM-DD-HHhmm.md

## Step 5 — Audit log

Append to .claude/audit.log:
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] | ship | [feature-slug] | END

## Final report

Shipped: [feature-slug]
Commit:  [hash] — [message]
Pushed:  [repo] → [branch]

Memory updated:
- roadmap/[feature-slug].md — feature description current
- roadmap/index.md — status updated
- schema/ — [updated / not changed]
- registry/ — [N additions / not changed]
- known-bugs.md — [N added / N resolved / not changed]
- roadmap/index.md — [N new tasks from deferred items / not changed]

Task closed.
